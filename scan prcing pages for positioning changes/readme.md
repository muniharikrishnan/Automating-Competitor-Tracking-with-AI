Automating Competitor Tracking with AI: Scan Pricing Pages for Positioning Changes

Overview

The Scan Pricing Pages for Positioning Changes script is designed to collect and track pricing information from competitors' websites, automatically identifying pricing fluctuations and changes in product positioning. It helps businesses monitor competitors' pricing strategies and observe any adjustments in product offerings over time.

This script scrapes pricing pages, extracts relevant pricing data, detects any changes, and visualizes these changes to identify trends. It is part of the larger Automating Competitor Tracking with AI project.

Features

Web Scraping: Scrapes competitor pricing pages to extract product names and prices.

Pricing Change Detection: Compares current pricing with historical data to identify fluctuations.

Positioning Changes: Detects shifts in product offerings, such as changes in tier positioning, features, or discounts.

Data Visualization: Visualizes pricing trends and changes over time using graphs.
Periodic Scanning: The script scans competitor pricing pages periodically (e.g., every 24 hours) to track pricing updates.
Use Cases

Competitor Analysis: Track how competitors adjust their pricing over time, and understand their pricing strategies.
Market Monitoring: Keep an eye on product offerings, promotional changes, and any shifts in market positioning.
Trend Identification: Recognize patterns or trends in pricing, such as price increases or product bundling.
Requirements

Python 3.x

requests library

beautifulsoup4 library

pandas library

matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization

Install the required libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib seaborn

Script Breakdown
fetch_pricing_page(url)
This function fetches the competitor's pricing page using the provided URL and extracts relevant pricing information (e.g., product names and prices). It uses requests for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML content.

track_pricing_changes(pricing_info, previous_data)
This function compares the extracted pricing data with previous data to detect changes. It processes the pricing information, removes any non-numeric characters (e.g., currency symbols), and identifies any price changes.

store_and_visualize_changes(data, filename="pricing_changes.csv")
This function stores the detected pricing changes in a CSV file and visualizes these changes over time using matplotlib and seaborn. The visual output shows a line chart with product prices over time.

Main Loop
The script continuously monitors the pricing page by running in a loop. It fetches new pricing data at regular intervals (e.g., every 24 hours) and updates the stored data and visualizations.

How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the folder containing the pricing_tracker.py file.

Edit the competitor_url variable in the main() function with the URL of your competitor's pricing page.

Run the script:


python pricing_tracker.py
The script will begin fetching pricing data, track changes over time, and visualize the trends in product pricing.

Example Output

Console Output: The script will display detected pricing changes in the console, showing which product's prices have changed and by how much.

Example or sample


Detected pricing changes:
Product A: $50.00 -> $45.00
Product B: $120.00 -> $115.00
Visualization: The script will generate a line chart showing how product prices have changed over time.

Customization

Competitor Pages: Modify the fetch_pricing_page() function to accommodate different competitor pricing page structures. You may need to adjust the CSS selectors based on the HTML of each page.

Scan Frequency: Adjust the time.sleep() duration in the script to control how often the pricing page is scanned (e.g., every hour, every day).

Price Formatting: Ensure that prices are cleaned and correctly formatted for comparison (removing symbols like $, â‚¬, etc.).

Future Improvements

Notifications: Add email or SMS notifications to alert you when pricing changes are detected.

Multi-Competitor Support: Extend the script to scrape multiple competitors' pricing pages and compare their pricing strategies.

Advanced Positioning Detection: Track changes in product positioning on the pricing page, such as changes in tier structure, product bundles, or featured products.
