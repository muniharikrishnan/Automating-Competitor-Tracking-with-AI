# Automating-Competitor-Tracking-with-AI - App Review Analysis

## Overview
The **Automating-Competitor-Tracking-with-AI** script is designed to help track and analyze reviews for a given app on the Google Play Store. It fetches reviews, performs sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, and extracts the most common weak points from negative reviews. The script then visualizes these weak points using a word cloud, providing a clear visual representation of areas where the app could be improved.

This script is particularly useful for businesses or developers looking to understand user feedback and identify potential areas for improvement in their app by analyzing competitors' reviews.

## Features
- **Review Fetching**: Fetches user reviews from the Google Play Store using the app's ID.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the reviews, categorizing them as positive, neutral, or negative.
- **Weak Point Extraction**: Extracts the most common words and phrases from negative reviews to identify potential weak points.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates a word cloud to visualize the most frequent weak points from the negative reviews.
- **Customizable**: You can replace the app ID with any other app ID from the Google Play Store to analyze reviews for that app.

## Use Cases
- **Competitive Analysis**: Analyze reviews of competing apps to find common complaints or weak points.
- **Product Improvement**: Identify areas where your own app can improve based on user feedback.
- **Sentiment Monitoring**: Track the sentiment of user reviews to gauge the overall satisfaction of users with your app.
- **Market Research**: Gain insights into customer sentiment and potential gaps in the market.

## Requirements
To run the script, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `textblob`
- `matplotlib`
- `wordcloud`

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 textblob matplotlib wordcloud


Script Breakdown
Fetching Reviews: The fetch_reviews() function scrapes reviews from the Google Play Store using the app's ID. It retrieves the latest reviews up to the specified limit (default is 100 reviews).
Sentiment Analysis: The analyze_sentiment() function uses TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on each review, classifying them as positive, neutral, or negative based on polarity.
Weak Point Extraction: The extract_weak_points() function processes the negative reviews and identifies the most common words or phrases to pinpoint the app's weaknesses.
Visualization: The visualize_weak_points() function generates a word cloud visualization of the most frequent weak points extracted from negative reviews.


How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the folder containing the app_review_analysis.py file.
Replace the app_id in the script with the actual Google Play Store app ID you wish to analyze.

Run the script:
python app_review_analysis.py

The script will fetch reviews, analyze sentiments, extract weak points from negative reviews, and visualize the weak points as a word cloud.

Replace the app_id in the script with the actual Google Play Store app ID you wish to analyze.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python app_review_analysis.py
The script will fetch reviews, analyze sentiments, extract weak points from negative reviews, and visualize the weak points as a word cloud.
Example Output
The output of the script will include:

The number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
A list of the top weak points based on negative reviews.
A word cloud visualization showing the most common weak points from the negative reviews.
For example, if you run the script for the app ID "com.automatingcompetitortrackingwithai", sample output:you may see output like this

Fetching reviews for App ID: com.automatingcompetitortrackingwithai...
Analyzing review sentiments...
Positive Reviews: 50
Neutral Reviews: 30
Negative Reviews: 20
Extracting weak points from negative reviews...
Top Weak Points: [('crash', 10), ('slow', 8), ('bug', 6), ('feature missing', 5), ...]
Visualizing weak points...


Customization
App ID: You can replace the app ID in the script to analyze reviews for any other app available on the Google Play Store.
Number of Reviews: Adjust the num_reviews parameter in the fetch_reviews() function to fetch more or fewer reviews.
Visualization: Customize the word cloud visualization by modifying parameters such as width, height, and background_color in the visualize_weak_points() function.
