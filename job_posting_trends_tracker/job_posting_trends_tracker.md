Job Posting Trends Tracker
Overview
The Job Posting Trends Tracker script is designed to collect and analyze job posting data from various job boards like AngelList. It tracks the trends of job postings, such as the number of postings for each job title, and visualizes these trends over time using bar charts.

This script fetches job data from platforms that do not provide an official API (e.g., AngelList), extracts relevant information such as job titles, and then aggregates and plots the trends of these job postings.

Features
Web Scraping: Scrapes job listings from AngelList for job titles and company names.
Trend Tracking: Tracks the frequency of job postings for each job title.
Data Visualization: Plots the trends of job titles over time using bar charts.
Periodic Tracking: The script can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., every 24 hours) to track the changes in job trends.
Use Cases
Market Analysis: Understand the demand for various job roles in the job market.
Competitor Analysis: Track job postings of competitors to observe shifts in their hiring strategies.
Trend Identification: Identify growing job categories and sectors based on the frequency of postings.
