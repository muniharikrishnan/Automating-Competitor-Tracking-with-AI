Notion Integration for Competitor Tracking Dashboard

Overview

This script integrates data from multiple sources (such as GitHub commits and job postings) into a Notion database. It fetches data from various tasks, such as monitoring GitHub commits and tracking job postings, and stores the results in your Notion workspace. The goal is to automate competitor tracking by storing valuable insights in a Notion database.

Features

Fetches commit data from GitHub using the GitHub API.

Scrapes job postings from various sources like LinkedIn, Indeed, and AngelList.

Integrates data from the monitor_commit.py script to capture commit frequency and trends.

Tracks job posting trends across multiple platforms.

Stores fetched and processed data into a specified Notion database using the Notion API.

Requirements

Python 3.6+

Notion API Token: You need a Notion API integration token. You can obtain this from your Notion Integrations page.
GitHub Personal Access Token: To fetch commit data from GitHub.

API Keys for Job Platforms: You will need API keys for job platforms (Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter) or set up web scraping for platforms that do not provide APIs.

Libraries:

requests
beautifulsoup4
matplotlib
notion-client

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib notion-client

Setup
N
otion API Integration:

Create a Notion integration via the Notion Developers page.

Share the target Notion database with the integration by inviting it to the database.
API Keys and Tokens:

Add your Notion Integration Token and GitHub Personal Access Token into the script. You can also add job platform API keys (Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter).

Replace the placeholder variables with your actual tokens in the script

notion_token = "your_notion_token"
github_token = "your_github_token"
database_id = "your_notion_database_id"


Notion Database:

The script will send data to your Notion database. Ensure your Notion database has the required fields to store the data, such as commit details, job titles, company names, etc.

Usage

Step 1: GitHub Commit Monitoring

The monitor_commits function fetches commit data from a specified GitHub repository and calculates:

Average time between commits
Commits per week
Time differences between the latest commits

You can pass the GitHub repository and your token to monitor commits:

monitor_commits("your_github_repo", "your_github_token")

Step 2: Job Postings Tracking

The job_postings.py script scrapes or uses APIs to fetch job postings from multiple platforms, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and AngelList.

Run the main function to start the scraping and tracking process:

from job_postings import main
main()

Step 3: Notion Integration
Once you have fetched the data, the script uses the Notion API to store the results in your database.

Example usage:

from notion_integration import store_data_to_notion

# Example: Store commit data to Notion
commit_data = monitor_commits("your_github_repo", "your_github_token")
store_data_to_notion(commit_data, database_id)


This will send the commit details to your Notion database.

Step 4: Automating the Process
You can schedule the script to run periodically to fetch and store new data. Use tools like cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to automate the process.

Example Structure
Your Notion database should be structured to accept the following data types:

Field Name	Field Type
Job Title	Text
Company	Text
Location	Text
Commit Message	Text
Commit Time	Date
Commits per Week	Number
Avg Time Diff	Number
Modify your database schema to include necessary fields based on the data you want to store.
