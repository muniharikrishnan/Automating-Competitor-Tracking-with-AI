Notion Dashboard for Competitor Intelligence

Overview

This Notion dashboard is designed to visualize and track various aspects of competitor intelligence, with a focus on GitHub commits, job postings, app reviews, and pricing page analysis. The dashboard is connected to a Notion database where relevant data is stored, fetched, and displayed in real-time. The data used in this dashboard is original data, not sample data, ensuring that the insights are accurate and applicable to real-world scenarios.

Dashboard Features

The dashboard contains the following key views and sections:

GitHub Commits:

This view displays GitHub commits data for monitoring competitor development speed.
Metrics such as the average time between commits, commits per week, and project repository information are visualized.
Job Postings:

This view tracks job postings of competitors to identify strategy shifts, such as hiring patterns, job requirements, and new technologies used.

A summary of recent job postings and their impact on competitor strategies is displayed.
App Reviews:

App review data is visualized to uncover potential weak points in competitor products.

The dashboard aggregates the most common feedback and customer sentiments, helping you spot areas of improvement.
Pricing Page Analysis:


This section displays competitor pricing strategies and changes, tracking product or service price adjustments.

Key metrics include price shifts, promotional discounts, and changes in positioning.
Summary Section:


A summary of all insights generated from the GitHub commits, job postings, app reviews, and pricing analysis.

This section provides high-level insights and trends to help in decision-making and strategic planning.

AI Synthesis Integration

The dashboard incorporates AI synthesis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate daily summaries. 

The summaries are automatically updated and reflect the latest competitor insights based on the data stored in the Notion database. The AI synthesizes large datasets and condenses them into digestible insights, which are then displayed on the dashboard for easy consumption.

Data Flow

Data is fetched from various sources (GitHub, job boards, app review sites, pricing pages) and stored in a Notion database.

The AI synthesis script processes this data, summarizes it, and stores the summaries in the Notion database.
The dashboard in Notion displays the summarized insights, providing an organized view of all competitor activities.

How It Works

The Notion API is used to fetch and interact with the data in the database.

Data is categorized and displayed in different views (Table, Timeline, Gallery) for clarity and easy access.

The AI synthesis module processes the data and generates daily summaries, which are automatically added to the Notion database.

The dashboard is updated regularly with new insights to keep track of competitor movements in real-time.

Tools Used

Notion API: For fetching and interacting with the database.

Hugging Face Transformers: For summarizing large data into concise insights using NLP models.

Python: For running the AI synthesis and automating the workflow.

Notion Views: For organizing and visualizing data in a meaningful way (Table, Timeline, etc.).

Future Enhancements

Integrating more data sources for comprehensive competitor analysis.

Expanding the AI summarization models to include more customized insights.

Automating data fetching and summarization with n8n to streamline the entire process.

Conclusion

This Notion dashboard is a powerful tool for competitor intelligence, designed to keep you informed about the latest trends and movements in the market. It leverages AI synthesis for daily summaries and organizes data in a way that's easy to understand and act upon.
